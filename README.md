# YelpCamp
Hi, my name is Yazan and this is my first (and hopefully not last) Github repository. 

YelpCamp is a platform for reviewing and booking campsites all over the globe. Users are able to scout through various and beautiful locations while simultaneously reading helpful reviews left by other users. Each 'campground' has it's unique location clearly displayed through making use of Google Maps API.

This platform is in its alpha stage and is potentially still subject to major changes in due course, although it was only built for learning purposes and thus certain UI features may not be dramatically improved, if at all.

I look forward to uploading more in the future.
